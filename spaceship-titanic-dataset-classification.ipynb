Features include demographic data, cabin information, and details about their in-ship expenditures. The target variable is Transported.\n","\n","Exploration:\n","Begin with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of features. Utilize visualization techniques to identify patterns and anomalies that could influence the predictive model's performance.\n","\n","Evaluation:\n","Submissions are evaluated on the accuracy of the predictions.
